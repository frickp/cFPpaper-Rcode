# cFPpaper-Rcode
Code used for J Cell Phys paper (2015) PMID: 25600161
 
These scripts were used to perform all statistical tests and fits, model training, and data visualization in the paper "Quantifying heterogeneity and dynamics of clonal fitness in response to perturbation" (PMID: 25600161). All code written by Peter Frick, Vanderbilt University.

The techniques demonstrated here include data processing, testing linearity assumptions by examining residuals, plotting dynamic data and model fits, KS-tests for differences in distributions, and error intervals

To use, copy and paste scripts into R console to reproduce plots and results
